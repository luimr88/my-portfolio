# Portfolio Page

## Description
I have created the beginnings of what is my portfolio page that I will use in order to
get a job after finishing the bootcamp. The portfolio reflects my current skills with html
and css. As I improve more changes will be made to the portfolio.

## Current Functionality of Portfolio
* Projects I have completed are shown in the portfolio and open in a different tab.
* Each Project shown has a link that takes you to the corresponding repo.
* A "about-me" section is available.
* Contact info is also available.
* Resume is not currently available since I haven't updated it yet to be presentable for web-development jobs.
* The features that allow the screen to be viewed at different sizes is not fully functional yet.
